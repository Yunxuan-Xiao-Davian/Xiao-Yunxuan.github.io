I'm a third year undergraduate student from [CityMind Lab](https://citymind.top/), [HKUSTGZ](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My research interest includes urban computing and data mining.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liang Yuxuan](https://yuxuanliang.com/) of CityMind Lab from [CityMind Lab](https://citymind.top/), HKUST(GZ). 
I was undergraduate student of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University.
